            <h2>Job Overview</h2>
            <p>We are looking for a dedicated, overly self-sacrificing individual who enjoys high stress, no recognition, and constant unreasonable demands. If you take pride in prioritizing work over basic human needs like sleep, family, and sanity, this is the perfect opportunity for you!</p>

            <h2>Key Responsibilities</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Work-Life What?</strong> Work late nights, early mornings, weekends, and holidays with the vague promise of "future rewards" (which may or may not materialize).</li>
                <li><strong>Salary Roulette:</strong> Accept occasional voluntary pay cuts because “the company is like family.”</li>
                <li><strong>Adaptability on Steroids:</strong> Be ready to redo the boss's last-minute “big ideas” that will inevitably be scrapped the next day.</li>
                <li><strong>Email Ninja:</strong> Respond to emails 24/7 to prove you're "passionate" about your job.</li>
                <li><strong>Event Flexibility:</strong> Organize team-building events you'll never attend because you'll be busy working on <em>actual work</em>.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Qualifications</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Bachelor's degree in something unrelated to what you'll actually do.</li>
                <li>Master's in Tolerating Chaos is preferred.</li>
                <li>Ability to smile and nod through pointless meetings.</li>
                <li>Minimum 5 years of experience taking blame for things outside your control.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Perks of the Job</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Infinite Overtime!</strong> (Paid? No, but you’ll gain <em>priceless experience</em>).</li>
                <li><strong>"Leadership Opportunities":</strong> Take on more responsibilities without the burden of a title or raise.</li>
                <li><strong>Complimentary Coffee:</strong> Keep the caffeine flowing so you can power through <em>another</em> 14-hour shift!</li>
                <li><strong>Recognition Program:</strong> If you hit all your KPIs, you'll get a “Thank You” email from upper management… maybe.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><em>Salary:</em> $Negotiable, but expect less.</p>
            <p>Because who doesn’t want to spend 80% of their waking hours at a desk for a vague sense of validation?</p>
            <p><strong>Apply today and join a workplace where ambition comes to die!</strong></p>
